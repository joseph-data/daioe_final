    "# Employment Weighted DAIOE\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the employment-weighted DAIOE aggregation pipeline and calls the reusable helpers from `scripts/02_weighting.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data lineage**: DAIOE raw subindices (tab-separated) are merged with the latest SCB employment snapshot for the same taxonomy.\n",
    "- **Hierarchy terms**: `code4` values are the finest SSYK occupations; levels 1–3 are progressively broader groups. `n_children` counts how many descendants a code has in the next level down.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formulas\n",

    "Employment-weighted aggregation for a group `g` (levels 1–3):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D^{(w)}_g = \\frac{\\sum_{k \\in g} E_k D_k}{\\sum_{k \\in g} E_k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where `E_k` is SCB employment and `D_k` is the DAIOE metric for each 4-digit child `k`. Missing DAIOE values are excluded from both numerator and denominator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple (unweighted) aggregation uses the arithmetic mean across the available children:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D^{(s)}_g = \\frac{1}{|S_g|} \\sum_{k \\in S_g} D_k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where `S_g` contains every child with a non-null DAIOE score. Percentile ranks are computed per `(year, level)` slice after stacking all levels, giving comparable order statistics per metric."
